# Hypothesis Testing on Children's Weights

This mini-project performs a **one-sample t-test** to analyze whether the average weight of 10-year-old children significantly differs from the hypothesized mean (32 kg).

## 🧪 Objective

To test the null hypothesis:

> H₀: The average weight of 10-year-old children is 32 kg  
> H₁: The average weight is different from 32 kg

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python
- Numpy
- Scipy (`ttest_1samp`)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for histogram and KDE)

## 📈 Features

- Takes input of children's weights from the user
- Performs one-sample t-test
- Outputs t-statistic and p-value
- Interprets result based on p-value
- Plots histogram with mean and hypothesized mean
